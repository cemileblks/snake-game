# Snake Game

## Description

This modernized version of the traditional snake game was created to practice the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building a simple interactive game. The goal was to incorporate interactivity with JavaScript and styling with CSS to achieve an appealing look.

## Installation

Getting started with the game is easy. Simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the on-screen buttons to control the snake. Earn points for each apple the snake consumes, and be mindful of the snake's speed as it grows longer!
